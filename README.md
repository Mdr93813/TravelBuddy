Problem Statement Tackled- GALLIVANTERS (Travel Buddy Application)
“If you want wings to be a travel maniac you don’t need RedBull, you need
Gallivanters.”

-Team Hum-Rahi
As almost all the final year coordinators are placed, they are planning to
make a trip to the well known GOPALMATH. We, for our seniors, are trying to
help them making their never succesful trips possible.
The basic building features of application-
• Multimode application(user & guest mode)
• Guest mode features- Finding route from remote locations.
• User mode features- Planning for upcomming trips, notifying users for
their upcomming trips.
• Providing user with proposed itinerary of the upcomming trips
beforehand.
• Providing information to user about weather, photos, hotspots near the
destinations place dynamically.
• Recommending nearby places to the user.
• Using Google API’s to make route on the map from source to
destination in real time.
• And many more surprising features...
